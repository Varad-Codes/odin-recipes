        1 green cardamom – optional<br>
        1 teaspoon coriander seeds<br>
    </ul>

    Making Masala Paste<br>
    <ul>
        In a grinder or blender take all the ingredients listed under "masala paste" – onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic,<br>
    green chilies, cashews, coriander leaves, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander seeds and cloves.<br>
    Grind all the ingredients to a smooth paste. If needed you can add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water while blending.<br>
    There should be no small chunks or pieces of cashews in the paste.<br>
    Set the ground paste aside.<br>
    Sautéing Masala<br>
    Heat oil in a 2-litre pressure cooker. Add the cumin seeds. Fry the cumin seeds until they splutter. (Read below<br>
    on how to cook in a pan and Instant pot.)<br>
    Then add the ground masala paste. Mix well. Take care while sautéing as the paste splutters. If there is too<br>
    much spluttering, then cover partly with a lid until the spluttering stops.<br>
    Saute for 10 to 12 minutes or more on a medium-low heat until the oil separates from the paste. The paste will<br>
    also become thick and look glossy.<br>
    Add all the ground spices – turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder. Mix well.<br>
    If adding cream or malai (clotted cream), you can add now. Stir and sauté for a minute.<br>
    Then add the green peas or matar. Mix again.<br>
    Add water and season with salt.<br>
    Making Matar Paneer In Stove-Top Pressure Cooker<br>
    Cover the cooker tightly and pressure cook for about 2 to 3 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes.<br>
    When the pressure drops on its own, open the lid of the pressure cooker.<br>
    If the curry appears thin, then simmer till it reaches the desired consistency. The consistency is medium and<br>
    neither thick nor thin.<br>
    If the gravy appears thick, then add some water and simmer for some minutes.<br>
    Add the paneer cubes. Mix well or simmer for a few seconds until the paneer cubes are cooked. For a slight sweet<br>
    taste, you can also add sugar just before you add the paneer cubes.<br>
    Don't overcook after adding paneer, as they will becomes dense and hard.<br>
    Garnish matar paneer with coriander leaves and serve hot or warm.<br>
    Instant Pot Matar Paneer Recipe<br>
    Make the masala paste with tomatoes, spices, herbs and cashews as listed above.<br>
    Press the sauté button of your Instant pot and let the display show “hot”. Add oil to the inner steel pot.<br>
    Crackle the cumin seeds first.<br>
    Add the ground masala paste and sauté stirring often until it thickens and looks glossy. You can press the sauté<br>
    button twice to bring the setting to less, if in case the pot becomes too hot.<br>
    Add the turmeric powder, red chilli powder and garam masala powder. Mix and sauté for a minute.<br>
    Add the green peas, 1 cup of water, salt and combine thoroughly, deglazing if needed. Press the cancel button.<br>
    Seal the lid and position the valve to sealing. Press the pressure cook/manual button and set the time to 3<br>
    minutes.<br>
    Pressure cook on high pressure. After you hear the beep sound when the cooking is complete, wait for 5 minutes<br>
    and then do a quick pressure release.<br>
    Press the cancel button. Add paneer cubes and mix well. Finally add some coriander leaves and mix again. Serve<br>
    hot or warm.<br>
    Making Mutter Paneer In A Pan On Stove-Top<br>
    First heat the oil in a heavy pan. Fry the cumin seeds.<br>
    Add the masala paste and sauté stirring often until the oil releases from the sides.<br>
    Add the ground spice powders and mix well.<br>
    Add the green peas, salt and about 1.5 to 2 cups water. Mix again.<br>
    Close the pan and cook the green peas until they soften. If the curry becomes too thick or dries up while<br>
    cooking, add some more water.<br>
    When the peas are cooked, add the paneer. Mix and switch off heat. To add more flavors, at this step together<br>
    with the paneer, you can add crushed kasuri methi.<br>
    Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.<br>
    Serving Suggestions<br>
    Matar paneer goes well with Indian flatbreads like roti, paratha, naan. It also tastes nice with cumin rice and<br>
    steamed basmati rice.<br>
    You can also eat it with puri (Indian fried bread). A side vegetable salad or raita pairs really well with the<br>
    combination of matar paneer and paratha.<br>
    Storage And Leftovers<br>
    If you have any leftovers refrigerate in an airtight container for 1 to 2 days. The curry will thicken after<br>
    cooling and so while reheating, add a bit of water to loosen the consistency.<br>
